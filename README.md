Task 1 - Project Understanding
As a data analyst, I acted as a bridge between the business and the data. I worked under the guidance of Mae Mulligan, an Accenture Managing Director, who was the client lead for Social Buzz. Social Buzz, our client, faced challenges in handling massive data due to rapid growth. Accenture was tasked with:

Conducting an audit of big data practices
Providing recommendations for an IPO
Analyzing popular content My specific task was to analyze sample datasets and visualize the popularity of different content categories, identifying the top 5 categories with the largest popularity. About Client : Social Buzz
Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Modelling
To address the business question of determining the top 5 popular content categories, I identified and worked with the following datasets:

Reaction Score (quantifying popularity)

Content ID

Reaction Types

Content Type

Category

I cleaned the data by:

Removing rows with missing values

Changing the data type of some values within columns

Removing irrelevant columns
Next, I created a final dataset by merging the three cleaned tables. This resulted in one comprehensive spreadsheet that highlighted the top 5 content categories by popularity.

Task 3 - Data Visualization and Storytelling
I prepared a PowerPoint presentation using the given template, incorporating various charts such as:

Pie Chart

Bar Chart

This presentation was designed to effectively communicate the key insights from my analysis.
